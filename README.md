# Customer Churn Prediction Web App

A full-stack machine learning app built using Flask to predict customer churn in the banking sector, explain predictions using SHAP, and generate actionable churn insights.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project identifies customers who are likely to leave a bank and helps target them with personalized interventions. It includes:

- Uploading test data
- Predicting churn probability
- Generating a list of high-risk customers based on a custom threshold
- SHAP-based interpretability per customer
- Aggregate churn analysis by demographic and account features

## ðŸ’¡ Features

    Churn Prediction: Upload test dataset (without labels) and predict churn probabilities.

    Custom Threshold: Choose threshold for flagging risky customers.

    Aggregate Analysis: Visualize how features like Age, CreditScore, Geography affect churn.

    SHAP Explainability: Understand which features contributed to an individual customer's churn decision.

    Modular Code: Organized into scripts for preprocessing, SHAP, analysis, and routing.

## ðŸ§ª Example Dataset

Use the provided uploaded_files/X_test.csv or your own dataset with the following columns:
['CustomerId', 'Surname', 'CreditScore', 'Geography', 'Gender', 'Age',  'Tenure', 'Balance', 'NumOfProducts', 'HasCrCard', 'IsActiveMember', 'EstimatedSalary']
